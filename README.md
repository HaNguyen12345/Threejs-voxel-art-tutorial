## Installation

No package manager / build system is needed since both Three.js modules and GSAP lib are imported with CDN + import map. You can run the page as it is on local server (any web server, really).


The page is using the following libs:

- Three.js + their addons OrbitControls, GLTFLoader and RoundedBoxGeometry, [more info](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation)

- GSAP to handle transitions between 3D models [more info](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation?checked=core)
